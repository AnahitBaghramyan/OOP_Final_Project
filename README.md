# Bank Management System

The Bank Management System is a Java application that allows users to manage bank accounts through a graphical user interface (GUI). It provides functionalities for adding and removing accounts, as well as displaying account details.

## Features

- Add new bank accounts with account number, balance, and owner information.
- Remove existing bank accounts from the system.
- View a list of all bank accounts with their respective details.
- GUI-based interface for ease of use.

## Usage

1. Run the `BankUI` class to launch the Bank Management System application.
2. Use the "Add Account" button to create new bank accounts by entering the account number, balance, and owner details.
3. Use the "Remove Account" button to delete existing bank accounts from the system.
4. The account list on the main interface displays all the accounts with their respective details.

## File Persistence

The application includes file reading and writing functionality to persist account data. Account information is stored in a file named `accounts.txt`. The file is automatically loaded when the application starts, and any changes to the account list are saved to the file.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies:
- Java Swing: For building the graphical user interface.
- Apache Commons IO: For simplifying file input/output operations.
